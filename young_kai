Assessment

I would say I am moving back and forth between mine, represent and refine. The data has been acquired and for the most part it has been parsed. I was able to work with it for A1a and A1b.

Goal - use examples from time series chapter to visualize a data set

Acquire data from online source
Parse and filter into new tsp file
Change file names in examples created from book
Change visual components to better reflect new data
